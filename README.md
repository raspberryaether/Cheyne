LyncIMLocalHistory (Raspberry Aether fork, name TBD)
===========================
Simple IM conversation tracker for people who want to keep the conversation 
history and can not use Lync or Skype for Business for it directly (disabled by IT administrators through group policy), or who may just want more control over the data.

Conversations are stored in [your documents]\LyncIMHistory folder.

Forked from LyncIMLocalHistory by Jonas Bujok (https://github.com/bujocek).

Thanks to Jonas for his blessing. Please, if you like this software, buy Jonas a beer:
